**Installing/Updating Node.js (if needed):**

If you don't have Node.js installed or your version is older than 18, here are common methods:

1.  **Using NVM (Node Version Manager) - Recommended:** NVM allows you to easily install and switch between different Node.js versions, which is highly recommended for developers.

    *   **Install NVM:**

        ```bash
        curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
        ```

        After installation, close and reopen your terminal, or run `source ~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc` for Zsh) to load NVM.

    *   **Install Node.js v20 (or latest LTS):**

        ```bash
        nvm install 20
        nvm use 20
        ```

    *   **Verify Installation:**

        ```bash
        node -v
        npm -v
        ```

2.  **Direct Installer:** Visit the official Node.js website (<mcurl name="nodejs.org" url="https://nodejs.org/"></mcurl>) and download the recommended LTS (Long Term Support) installer for your operating system (macOS, Windows, Linux). Follow the installation wizard.

3.  **Using Homebrew (macOS):**

    ```bash
    brew install node
    ```

Ensure Node.js is correctly installed and accessible from your terminal before proceeding to the next step.
