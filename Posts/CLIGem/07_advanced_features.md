Now that you've mastered the basics of the Gemini CLI, it's time to explore some of its more advanced features. These features will help you to take your development workflow to the next level and unlock even more of the power of AI.

### Customizing the Output

The Gemini CLI provides a variety of options for customizing the output of its commands. You can use the `--output` flag to specify the output format, and you can use the `--template` flag to specify a custom template for the output.

For example, you can use the following command to output the explanation of a file in JSON format:

```bash
$ gemini explain auth.py --output json
```

You can also create your own custom templates using the Handlebars templating language. This allows you to format the output of the Gemini CLI in any way you want.

### Creating Custom Commands

The Gemini CLI allows you to create your own custom commands using its powerful plugin system. This allows you to extend the functionality of the Gemini CLI and create new commands that are tailored to your specific workflow.

To create a new command, you can use the `plugin create` command. This will create a new directory with a template for your new command.

You can then edit the files in this directory to define the behavior of your new command. You can use the full power of the Gemini API to create commands that can do almost anything you can imagine.

### Integrating with Other Tools

The Gemini CLI is designed to be a good citizen of the command line. It can be easily integrated with other tools to create powerful and flexible workflows.

For example, you can pipe the output of the `explain` command to the `less` command to view the explanation in a pager:

```bash
$ gemini explain auth.py | less
```

You can also use the Gemini CLI in your shell scripts to automate common tasks.

### The Sky's the Limit

The advanced features of the Gemini CLI are incredibly powerful and flexible. They allow you to customize the tool to your specific needs and create new workflows that were never before possible.
