# Page 5: Generating Unit Tests Automatically

![Test Generation Mockup](gemini_cli_test_generation.png)

Writing unit tests is a critical part of the software development process. It's how we ensure that our code is working as expected, and it's how we prevent regressions from being introduced into our codebase. But it can also be a tedious and time-consuming process.

The Gemini CLI can help you to write unit tests more quickly and easily with its `test` command. This command can automatically generate unit tests for your code, and it can even suggest edge cases that you might have missed.

### The `test` Command

The `test` command takes a file path as an argument and generates a new test file with a set of unit tests for the code in that file.

Let's say you want to generate unit tests for your `auth.py` file. You would run the following command:

```bash
$ gemini test auth.py
```

The Gemini CLI will then analyze the file and generate a new file called `test_auth.py` with a set of unit tests for the functions and classes in `auth.py`.

### Customizing the Tests

The `test` command is highly customizable. You can use a variety of options to control how the tests are generated.

For example, you can use the `--framework` flag to specify the testing framework you want to use. The Gemini CLI supports a wide range of testing frameworks, including:

*   **pytest**
*   **unittest**
*   **Jest**
*   **Mocha**
*   **And much more.**

You can also use the `--coverage` flag to specify the minimum code coverage you want to achieve. The Gemini CLI will then generate additional tests to meet your desired coverage level.

### A Powerful Tool for Test-Driven Development

The `test` command is a powerful tool that can help you to write better unit tests more quickly and easily. It's an essential part of any test-driven development workflow, and it's a great way to improve the quality of your code.
