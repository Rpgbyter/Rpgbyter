## Tech Layoffs & Mental Health: The Hangover After the Gold Rush

The party's over. The keg is empty, the music has stopped, and the harsh light of morning is revealing the wreckage of the tech industry's decade-long bender.

The layoffs, when they came, were swift and brutal. One day you were a "rockstar developer" with a six-figure salary and a kombucha tap in the office, and the next you were a statistic in a spreadsheet, your access to the company Slack unceremoniously revoked.

And the whiplash has been brutal.

For years, we were told that we were the chosen ones. That we were building the future, and that our work was changing the world. We were plied with free food, unlimited vacation, and a sense of purpose that was as intoxicating as it was illusory. We weren't just employees; we were family.

And then, in the blink of an eye, the family turned on us. The all-hands meetings that used to be about celebrating our wins were now about "restructuring" and "synergies" and "right-sizing." The free lunches were replaced with a cold, corporate email informing us that our services were no longer required.

The impact on our mental health has been devastating. The anxiety, the depression, the sense of betrayal â€“ it's a toxic cocktail that has left many of us feeling lost and alone. We're grieving not just the loss of a job, but the loss of an identity. The loss of a future we thought we were building.

And the worst part? The gaslighting. The endless stream of articles and LinkedIn posts from the very same people who caused this mess, telling us to be "resilient" and to "embrace change" and to "see this as an opportunity." The tone-deaf advice from the out-of-touch executives who are still sitting on their piles of cash, telling us to just "learn to code" in a different language.

I'm tired. I'm tired of the platitudes, the hypocrisy, and the complete lack of empathy from the people who are supposed to be our leaders. I'm tired of pretending that this is normal, or that it's just the cost of doing business.

We need to talk about this. We need to be honest about the toll that this industry has taken on our mental health. We need to support each other, and we need to demand better from the companies that we work for.

The gold rush is over. It's time to start cleaning up the mess.
