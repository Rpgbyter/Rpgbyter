## AI Ethics in 2024: A Dumpster Fire of Good Intentions

Welcome to 2024, where the AI ethics conversation has officially reached the "thoughts and prayers" stage. We've moved on from the quaint, academic debates about trolley problems and paperclip maximizers, and into the messy, real-world consequences of unleashing powerful, inscrutable algorithms on an unsuspecting public.

And what a mess it is.

We have AI models that can generate photorealistic images of anything you can imagine, but can't seem to shake the racist and sexist biases of the data they were trained on. We have AI-powered hiring tools that can analyze a candidate's facial expressions, but can't tell the difference between a thoughtful pause and a blank stare. We have AI-generated news articles that are indistinguishable from the real thing, but are completely untethered from reality.

And what is the response from the tech giants who have unleashed these digital demons? A flurry of vague, non-committal "AI ethics principles" that are about as meaningful as a chocolate teapot. They talk about "fairness" and "transparency" and "accountability," but they can't even agree on what those words mean, let alone how to implement them.

The EU is trying, bless its heart, with the AI Act. But it's like trying to build a dam with a teaspoon while a tsunami is on the horizon. The technology is moving too fast, the incentives are too skewed, and the potential for misuse is too great.

And let's not even get started on the grifters and the charlatans who are using the AI hype to peddle their snake oil to a gullible public. The "AI-powered" everything, from toasters to toothbrushes, that are about as intelligent as a brick. The self-proclaimed "AI ethicists" who are more interested in building their personal brand than in having a meaningful conversation about the future of humanity.

I'm tired. I'm tired of the empty promises, the disingenuous apologies, and the wilful ignorance of the people who are building this technology. I'm tired of being told that we need to "move fast and break things," when the things that are being broken are our privacy, our democracy, and our shared sense of reality.

We need to do better. We need to demand more from the people who are building this technology. We need to have a serious, grown-up conversation about the kind of future we want to live in. And we need to do it now, before it's too late.
